# clippys
simple clipboard manager for efficiency freaks

No GUI, no frills, no nonsense

Just ctrl+c+0, ctrl+c+9, ctrl+c+8 to copy to clipboard 0, 9, or 8
ctrl+b+0, ctrl+b+9, ctrl+b+8 to paste from clipboard 0, 9, or 8

## Known limitations, plans for updates

Currently limited to just 3 clipboards. In future update, you'll be able to add as many as you want (and possibly name them)

Using 0, 9, 8 instead of 1, 2, 3 because they are easier to reach after ctrl+c (try it!)

Using ctrl+b because it seems to be the only key combo that no other program uses. (jk, word processors use it for bold... so I'll probably change it in next update)

Might switch to a different keyboard library - this one doesn't seem to handle alt correctly, which would be nice.

Only tested on Windows, but the libraries used are cross platform (supposedly)
